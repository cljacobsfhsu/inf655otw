                This wargame was introduced at the Hackito Ergo Sum (HES) 2011 conference in Paris and is centered around the fictitious company dildosfromspace.com<br><br>

                The wargame has its own website with the entire backstory. You can find it <a href="http://agent7a69.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>
                    
                As of September 2011, the Abraxas game has been released to the public and can be downloaded <a href="http://images.overthewire.org/Abraxas%20-%20OverTheWire%20Wargame.ova">here</a>.<br><br>

                   <h3>Introduction</h3>
                   The story around this wargame revolves around a secret agent called Agent 7a69.
                    This agent was recruited to steal a prototype from the factory of a company called 
                    Dildo's From Space (DFS). The task, codenamed Job <span class="ur">331</span>, was to be an undercover
                    operation and Agent 7a69 was to act alone. After several months, Agent 7a69 
                    disappeared under mysterious circumstances. All he left was his journal on Job <span class="ur">331</span>.<br><br>
                    You are a newly-appointed talented secret agent recruited to continue Agent 7a69's
                    mission. Your mission is the same. It is best that you start with Agent 7a69's logbook
                    which is located at <span class="ur">http://agent7a69.blogspot.com/</span>. God speed!<br><br>
                    <span class="ip">Note:</span> a full copy of the logbook can also be found in /BackgroundStory.pdf of this diskimage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h3>How to Play?</h3>
                    First, download the diskimage because it is intended to run locally.
                    Import the diskimage into your favorite virtualization software. The game is based on Ubuntu, 
                    so any virtual hardware supported by Ubuntu should be fine in your virtualization environment.<br><br>

                    When booted, abraxas configures its network interface with<br><br>
                    IP <span class="ip">192.168.66.66/24</span><br>
                    gateway <span class="ip">192.168.66.254</span><br>
                    DNS <span class="ip">server 8.8.8.8 (Google)</span><br><br>
                    There is no need to give access to the internet to get this VM working.<br><br>

                    You can use SSH to login to the VM. For maintenance reasons, there is an account 'otw' with 
                    password 'otw' with sudo rights to get a root account. This maintenance account is not part of
                    the wargame and should not be used when playing the wargame fairly.<br><br>
                    Once the game is running, find the <span class="ip">logbook</span> mentioned earlier and read it. Instructions on how
                    to start playing are in there.
                </p>

                    <h3>History of This Wargame</h3>
                    This wargame was reachable on <span class="ur">abraxas.labs.overthewire.org</span> and <span class="ur">abraxas.dildosfromspace.com</span>.
                    abraxas.dildosfromspace.com, which both resolved to the same IP address.
                    With the release of this diskimage, both DNS records have been updated to 
                    <span class="ip">192.168.66.66</span>, which is the local IP address of this offline version of the game. The dildosfromspace.com domainname might no longer exist when you read this.

                    Originally, this wargame was created for the Hackito Ergo Sum 2011 conference in Paris,
                    which was held from April 7th to April 9th 2011. Afterwards, the wargame was opened up
                    to any player.
